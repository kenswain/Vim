## Modifications

I have made a number of changes (hence the name change) to make it more functional for me, including the following:

- I removed the prompt for editing or deleting posts, and am using a command to skip those steps during blogging workflow (see below)
- I moved the post type from Markdown to HTML because I have Wordpress doing Markdown conversion on the server side

## Commands

I set up a few shortcuts that I use during day-to-day blogging:

### Starting workflow

From the shell I launch these two character shortcuts to begin blogging immediately.

-  <code>alias nb="vim +BlogNew</code>
-  <code>alias eb="vim +BlogList</code>

### Inside Vim

Once inside Vim I can run these.

-  <code>nnoremap <leader>b :BlogSave publish<CR></code>
-  <code>nnoremap <leader>h :set ft=HTML<CR><CR></code>

### Credits

All credit to Pentie for creating VimRepress, which this is based on.
